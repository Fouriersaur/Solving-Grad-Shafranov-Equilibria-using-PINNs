# Solving Grad Shafranov Equilibria using PINNs
* Solving the PDE that governs the magnetic confinement of plasma in a fusion reactor based on both Hard and parametric constraints  from the iTER fusion reactor 
* Benchmarked PINN-calculated magnetic flux against analytical solutions of the PDE
* Applied different activation functions for the PINN and recorded their respective performance
